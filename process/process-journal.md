We finally started work on the game and it seems to going well. The team seems motivated and very keen on the vision and spirits seem to be high!

### Art

The art style should definitely be 3D low poly as we have to put procedurally generated train compartments one after the other in case we do an endless runner.

### Endless runner or level based?

Should we go for the generic endless runner genre which is non risky but also too used by now or should we do something level based, trying to turn an endless runner into a possible rogue-like game.
