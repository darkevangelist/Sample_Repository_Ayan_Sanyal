## Menu

- ~~Connect games to menu items properly~~
- ~~Add icons to options~~
- ~~Add sounds to interaction~~

## General

- ~~How to indicate end-game situations? Some kind of overlay?~~
- ~~Make unmovable pieces shake rather than highlight~~
- ~~Investigate castling (make illegal in games where it can't work)~~
- ~~Add a highlight (border?) to show whose turn it is (and don't highlight during no input, should help usability a lot)~~
- ~~Reduce delay for no move message as it's annoyingly slow now (or allow play while it displays)~~
- ~~Check all turn indicators~~
- ~~Make the turn indicator swap time be a no-input time for the player~~
