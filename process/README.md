# Process Documentation

This is supposed to be process documentation of the game. More blah blah blah about what kind of game design model you followed and why you made this game.

### [Closing Statement](./closing-statement.md)
A final discussion of the game with hindsight.

### [To Do](./to-do.md)
The todo list of practical tasks for the project.

### [Process Journal](./process-journal.md)
A journal that includes high-level reflections on the design and development process, intended to be complementary to the [commit history of the repository](https://github.com/darkevangelist/Sample_Repository_Ayan_Sanyal/commits/master).

### Research Questions (tbd)
Attempts to frame what's meaningful about this project.
